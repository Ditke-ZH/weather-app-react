I built a React weather app in SheCodes React, an advanced 6-week JavaScript/React coding workshop. Building upon my previously-gained knowledge, I also became skilled in Bootstrap, APIâ€™s real-life development workflow, hosting, and advanced JavaScript. I combined all of these skills to create a fully-functioning weather app.

Technologies:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- React
- Bootstrap
- API intergration
